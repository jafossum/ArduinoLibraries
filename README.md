# ArduinoLibraries
Collection of ArduinoLibraries developed with VisualMicro.

Collection of different .cpp and .h libraries for different Arduino use.

For the functionality of the different Libraries, look in the subfolders.

## JAF_FrequencyScheduler

This library chedules appended tasks (methods) at a given tickCount based on the set frequence.

This works repetitive, so there is no need to re-append task after it has been performed.

Methods and frequenceies are provided at startup.

## JAF_MavLink

[MavLink](http://www.qgroundcontrol.org/mavlink/start) based library containing my own implementation 
of the MavLink protocoll using the MavLink [mavgenerate](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink) for C++ 
projects.

This will be an ongoing project with MavLink methods added as they are needed into my own MavLink definition 
files.
